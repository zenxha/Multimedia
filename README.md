## Week 1 of Project Code
On the first week, we worked on figuring out how html worked so that we could create our website. If you scroll over the name of a member in our group, it links you to their a personal website.

## Week 2 of Project Code
On the second week, we started the web scaper part of the project and also incooperated in some code from Jinja. 
Kian tested out Amazon at first, but it said a contract was needed in order to use their website. So at the moment, we have etsy to use as a website.
